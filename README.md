# Donald-Trump Tweets Data
I have a data set regarding the tweets posted by Donald trump from 2014 to 2021. And I have performed several  exploratory analysis using pandas.

I have used pandas, matplotlib libraries in this project.

First I droped Nan values from the DataFrame and changed the column type (to_datetime)
And also deleted unnamed column from the DataFrame.

## After getting over with data cleaning, I moved to exploratory section. This section explores following question related to the data.

- In which year did Donald Trump post the most tweets? 
- Adding new columns for month and year
- Visualization of the tweets over the years 
- IN 2020 , IN WHICH MONTH DID DONALD TRUMP POST THE MOST TWEETS? 
- Visualization for indicating the months of 2020 regarding tweets
- Who did Donald Trump target the most?
- Which insults did Donald Trump use the most frequently?
- What did and how many tweets did Donald Trump post on the first of new year? 

## To answer these question I have used several pandas and plotting methods. They include:

- Reading data from csv file to create a new DataFrame.
- Added column
- Used groupby to perform aggregate analysis.
- Plotted barcharts
- Labelled all the graphs
